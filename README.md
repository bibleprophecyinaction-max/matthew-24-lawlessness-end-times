# In the End Times – Lawlessness Shall Abound

Jesus Christ warned that in the last days, iniquity would increase and the love of many would grow cold (Matthew 24:10–12, KJV).

Today, we see rising violence, betrayal, hatred, economic turmoil, and moral decline across the globe. Each day brings disturbing headlines — wars, crime, corruption, and societal breakdown.

## Jesus’ Warning

Matthew 24:12 says:

“And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.”

Matthew 24:10 also warns:

“And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.”

These are not random events — they are signs of the end times.

## The Escalation of Evil

The Bible declares in 2 Timothy 3:13:

“Evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse.”

Lawlessness will not decrease with time. According to Scripture, the end will come suddenly (Daniel 9:26) like a flood — devastating and swift.

## The 7-Year Tribulation Period

The coming Tribulation period will bring:
- Global chaos
- War and economic collapse
- Rise of the Antichrist (Man of Sin)
- One world government
- Mark of the Beast system (Revelation 13:16–18)

During this period, allegiance will be demanded. Those who refuse the mark will face severe persecution.

## The Hope of Believers

The Bible teaches that believers in Jesus Christ will be delivered before the Tribulation through the Rapture (1 Corinthians 15:50–57).

Now is the time to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and be saved. Today faith comes with freedom. During the Tribulation, faith will come with intense persecution.

## A Serious Question

Are you ready for the times ahead?

The increase of lawlessness is not accidental — it is prophetic.
